# Clipboard Recovery Program

This is a program designed to run locally on Windows 11. When active, it allows the user to recover the last entry of the clipboard and writes its content manually, simulating keyboard clicks in its entirety, including spaces, new lines, and everything else. This is achieved by using the shortcut "Shift + V".

## Installation

2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Run the installer.

## Usage

1. Start the program.
2. Copy any text or data.
3. Press "Shift + V" to recover the last entry of the clipboard and write its content.
